Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another record. When you use an alias record to route traffic to an AWS resource, Route 53 automatically recognizes changes in the resource. For example, suppose an alias record for example.com points to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer at lb1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com. If the IP address of the load balancer changes, Route 53 automatically starts to respond to DNS queries using the new IP address. \n If an alias record points to an AWS resource, you can't set the time to live (TTL); Route 53 uses the default TTL for the resource. If an alias record points to another record in the same hosted zone, Route 53 uses the TTL of the record that the alias record points to. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html",

With simple routing, you typically route traffic to a single resource, for example, to a web server for your website. If you choose the simple routing policy, you can't create multiple records that have the same name and type, but you can specify multiple values in the same record, such as multiple IP addresses. If you choose the simple routing policy for an alias record, you can specify only one AWS resource or one record in the current hosted zone. If you specify multiple values in a record, Route 53 returns all values to the recursive resolver in random order, and the resolver returns the values to the client that submitted the DNS query. The client then chooses a value and resubmits the query. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-simple.html",
